(1) Edit the Makefile to suit your system -- follow the descriptions
    therein
(2) type "make install"
(3) test with "./strobe localhost"
(4) read the man page

(5) if you find any staticly assigned tcp ports that it doesn't know about, then
    send me a description so I can add it to the strobe.services database.

Happy strobing!
